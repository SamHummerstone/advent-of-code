Now, I am very aware how janky this is, but I want to not over-organise until I need to. This is to learn why things should be written in certain ways the hard way.

Worth noting that the tests made things much easier and removed the mental load of finding reasons why something stops working.

I did have to get a hint for part two, to sub out the middle letters only when converting textual numbers to digits in order to preserve shared characters where they exist. This is far simpler than the rabbithole I was heading down, and is a good reminder that simple is better, and if it's getting overly complicated, it's probably wrong.
