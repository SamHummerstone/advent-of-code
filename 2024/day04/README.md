I effing hate these wordsearch tasks. I disliked them on Project Euler and I still do.

I know in my head what I am trying to do (Find the first letter, use a double `for` loop to travel on the X axis, Y axis, or both axes for diagonal), and yet I can't get it into code. I think I am trying to not brute force it by checking each element one at a time rather than getting all 4 and comparing it the to full match.

I am going to skip this for now. Perhaps I'll come back, but I am not learning anything and am just getting frustrated.
